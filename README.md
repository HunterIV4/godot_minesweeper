# Minesweeper

 ![Minesweeper in Godot Engine](/.media/example_screenshot.png)

A refactored minesweeper game made using Godot 4.3. Originally created by Awfyboy here: [Minesweeper in Godot](https://github.com/Awfyboy/Minesweeper)

This has the same core features as the original but is refactored to be more modular and use signals rather than a strongly coupled design. This isn't necessarily the "best" or "only" way of doing things, but it's useful to be able to compare two very different ways of handling the same game.
